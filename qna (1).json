         ],
         "a": "We at Yellow Circle, Inc. (“Yellow Circle,” “we,” “us,” “our”) know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. By accessing or using the Services you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. Remember that your use of Yellow Circles Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Service, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use here without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Service.\n\nPlease read on to learn more about how we collect and use your information; if you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy practices, please send us a detailed email to support@yellowcircle.net, write us, or call us.\n\nWHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?\nThis Privacy Policy explains how Yellow Circle collects and uses information from its Services users, including our treatment of personally identifiable information. This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies that Yellow Circle does not own or control, or to individuals that Yellow Circle does not employ or manage, including providers of Publisher Software.\n\nHOW IS CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION TREATED?\nIf you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), you may only use the Services and disclose information to us with your parent’s or guardian’s express consent. Review this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian and make sure you understand it, and do the same with the privacy policies of all websites you visit or mobile applications you use.\n\nWe only collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student’s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described in more detail in the Terms of Service) to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete the information. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at support@yellowcircle.net.\n\nWhen we use the term “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are referring to personally identifiable information of individual, non-student registrants of the Services. References to “Children’s Personal Information” only apply to personally identifiable information of users who have registered for the Services as minor students (i.e., students under the age of 18). General references to “information” apply to all users.\n\nWHAT INFORMATION DOES YELLOW CIRCLE DISPLAY OR COLLECT?\nInformation You Provide to Us\nWe receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Services, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way. This information may include, without limitation, Personal Information such as your name, user name, email address, phone number, profile picture, school affiliation and location, and any other information necessary for us to provide our Services. If you are a student registrant, the only Children’s Personal Information we require is your name and user name; through the functionality of the Services, you may also be permitted to input a profile picture, and an email address or phone number.\n\nInformation Collected Automatically\nWe receive and store certain types of usage information whenever you interact with the Services; this information is not Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information. For example, Yellow Circle automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Yellow Circle cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Services, and the number and frequency of visitors to our site and its components.\n\nCookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer or mobile device to enable our systems to recognize your computer or device and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Yellow Circle cookies do not collect Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your user name or email address is. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you may not be able to log in or use many of the Services’ most attractive features without cookies enabled. Our partners, affiliates, and service providers may also transmit cookies to your computer or device, to help provide you with an optimal online experience. For example, if you are playing a learning game offered by a Publisher, that Publisher may transmit cookies to you, allowing you to save your game history. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy and we do not have access or control over such cookies.\n\nThe Services may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how the Services are used.\n\nWHAT DOES YELLOW CIRCLE USE MY INFORMATION FOR?\nGenerally\nWhen you use the Services, you may set up your personal profile and transmit information through various channels, depending on the category of user (“User Category”) you are registered as, and as permitted by the functionality of the Services. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and allows users to set up a user account and profile through the Services.\n\nPersonal Information\nThe Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information and services, customizing your experience, and communicating with you about the Services.\n\nChildren’s Personal Information\nWe use the Children’s Personal Information for creating your individual account, customizing your experience, and for sending you notifications via the Services from your teacher, and from Yellow Circle (regarding your use of the Services) (“Notifications”). Please note that your parent or guardian, as well as an administrator, can view all activity and content associated with your student account, including your Children’s Personal Information.\n\nYour email address\nIf you provide us your email address, we may send you email communications. Web beacons may also be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails (and which links within those emails) have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you are a student, we will only use your email address to send you Notifications. To opt out of receiving emails from us, please contact us at support@yellowcircle.net. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us via email, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for visiting this Privacy Policy from time to time to review any changes.\n\nUsage Information\nYellow Circle uses this type of aggregate data to enable us to figure out how often users use parts of the Services, so that we can make the Services appealing and relevant to as many users as possible, and customize and improve those Services. As part of our use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners (in a non-personally-identifiable format) about how our users use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our partners’ services and the Services to help provide you with an optimal online experience. We may link usage information to Personal Information and Children’s Personal Information that we collect through the Services, but we will only use this linked information internally (for example, to customize your experience), and will not disclose it in linked format to third parties.\n\nMobile Usage Information\nThis information is used to determine the device capabilities and usage trends which allows us to better understand which devices we should support and what features are most frequently used.\n\nWILL YELLOW CIRCLE SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?\nPersonal Information and Children’s Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information; the short answer… NO!\n\nIS INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?\nYour Yellow Circle account Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We also use coding practices which take steps to prevent attack on our Services from web browsers and malicious scripts, by processing all actions through several permission verification checks.\n\nYou may help protect against unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.\n\nWhen you enter sensitive information (such as a any personal information) in our system, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).\n\nYellow Circle endeavors to keep your information private; however, we cannot guarantee security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information. For additional information about the security measures we use in connection with the Services, please contact us at support@yellowcircle.net.\n\nThe Services contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites (but you should read all third parties’ privacy policies to ensure you understand them). This Privacy Policy only governs information collected by Yellow Circle on the Services.\n\nWILL YELLOW CIRCLE EVER CHANGE THIS PRIVACY POLICY?\nWe may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time for any reason. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information, we will notify you via email or by posting an announcement on the Services with two (2) weeks prior notice before the change becomes effective. Users are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services upon the conclusion of such two (2) week notice period. This notice period only applies to changes to the Privacy Policy; you understand that it may not be possible in certain situations to provide advance notice of other changes to the Terms of Service (for example, where a change to the Terms is necessary to comply with legal requirements).\n\nWHAT IF I’M IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY?\nWhen you use the Services, you are consenting to have your data transferred to and processed in the United States. All of Yellow Circles servers are currently in the United States, and we aren’t able to process your information within the borders of any other country. Given this limitation, if your use of the Services or disclosure of certain information to Yellow Circle would violate any law that is applicable to you, your right to use the Services and/or disclose such information is revoked, as it is wherever use of the Services is prohibited by law (as described in the Terms of Service).\n\nYellow Circle complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

You can spin up a WordPress website, Joomla, Drupal, and a host of programming languages. In order to access those sites, you must be logged into your account and access them through a desktop instance of your choice.\n\nWe have included a few desktop images to choose from such as Windows, Ubuntu, mint, etc. When you launch a website such as WordPress you will access it from one of these desktop instances.\n\nThis tutorial requires you to have already completed the Getting Started series so you have a solid understanding of how to launch instances.\n\nTo start, spin up both a WordPress (small flavor) and Linux mint (medium flavor) instance. We are going to use Linux mint to access the WordPress website. See below for how it should look.\n\nIn the IP address column, you will see a number in the WordPress row. You will use this number to access your WordPress website from your web browser in your Linux mint instance. Note that your number will likely be different than mine.\nAfter noting your IP address, log into the Linux mint instance through the console. If you do not remember how to do this, re-watch the Spinning up Your First Instance video.\nNow that you’re logged into your Linux mint instance, open up the Firefox browser usually found in the task bar at the bottom as shown here.\n\n\nIn the address bar, type the IP address we found earlier and press enter as shown below. I have used my IP address for this. Make sure you use the one you found for your WordPress instance.\n\nPress enter, and you will be presented with your new WordPress website!Find some websites that teach WordPress and use your new WordPress instance to practice!\nIf you find you cannot get to your WordPress browser, follow this tutorial on Access & Security.",

            "WHAT ARE YOUR TERMS OF USE"
         ],
         "a": "EFFECTIVE DATE: NOVEMBER 1, 2014\nIMPORTANT! If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many places, this is 18 years old), then you must get your parent or guardian to read these terms and agree to them for you, before you use Yellow Circle or provide any information to us. Please review this agreement with your parent or guardian so that you both understand how Yellow Circle works and what restrictions apply to your use of our websites and services. Remember, always get an adult’s permission before going online.\n\nThanks for using Yellow Circle! We’re glad you’re here, but there are some rules you need to agree to before you use our websites and services (“Services”). When we use the word “Services,” we mean not only the yellowcircle.net website, but also all the other websites, products, services and applications made available by Yellow Circle. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms or the Services, please contact us at support@yellowcircle.net, (916) 581-0101, or PO Box 2383 Elk Grove CA 95759-2383.\n\nTHE CONTRACT.\nThese Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Yellow Circle, Inc. (“Yellow Circle,” “we” and “us”). You must agree and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services.\n\nThese Terms include the provisions in this document and in the Yellow Circle Privacy Policy.\n\nOur Services are constantly changing, to keep up with the dynamic needs of learners everywhere – so, these Terms might need to change, too. If they do change, we will do our best to tell you in advance by placing a notification on the yellowcircle.net website, or we might send you an email. In certain situations (for example, where a change to the Terms is necessary to comply with legal requirements), we may not be able to give you advance notice. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be provided in advance, as described in the privacy policy.\n\nIf you don’t like the new Terms, you are free to reject them – unfortunately, that means you won’t be able to use the Services anymore. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, then please remember that means you agree to all of the Terms.\n\nExcept for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.\n\nDO YOU CARE ABOUT MY PRIVACY?\nYellow Circle takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the entire current Yellow Circle Privacy Policy, please click here and for information regarding the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”), please click here, because we get a lot of questions about that.\n\nCOPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. Therefore, we only collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student’s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described in the following paragraph) to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at support@yellowcircle.net.\n\nIf you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. You are responsible for understanding how any Publisher Software (defined and described below) that you install on behalf of yourself or other users may collect and use information of users of Yellow Circle Services. When obtaining consent, you must provide parents and guardians with our Privacy Policy. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. For more information on COPPA, please click here. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services as part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school and/or district.\n\nWHAT ARE THE BASICS OF USING YELLOW CIRCLE?\nFirst, you have to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“Yellow Circle User ID”). Also, if you are a school or district, you may be permitted to register a school or district “subdomain” within yellowcircle.net (an “Yellow Circle Subdomain”). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You can’t select for your Yellow Circle User ID a name that you don’t have the rights to use or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person, nor can you select an Yellow Circle Subdomain name that you don’t have the right to use. In certain situations, your Yellow Circle User ID may be selected for you by your school or district; the same rules apply to them when they select an Yellow Circle User ID for you. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.\n\nYou represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf, as we described earlier). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity (for example, if you’re an administrator agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your district), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms.\n\nYou promise to only use the Services for your personal, internal, non-commercial, educational use, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for you using the Services in a way that breaks the law.\n\nPlease be a good digital citizen at all times – we are all in this together!\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.\nThe Content\nThe materials displayed or performed on the Services (including, but not limited to, text, graphics, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions (defined below), and so forth) (the “Content”) are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including Yellow Circles) rights. For example, if someone shares a really creative lesson plan with you on Yellow Circle, that doesn’t mean you can print it out and start distributing it to other people – unless the owner specifically told you in writing that you could.\n\nYou understand that Yellow Circle owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), creative derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.\n\nThe Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply.\n\nUser Submissions\nAnything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission.” Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.\n\nFor all User Submissions, you hereby grant Yellow Circle a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on your iPhone as well as your computer) and reproduce such User Submission, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.\n\nIf you store a User Submission in your own personal Yellow Circle account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant Yellow Circle the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of displaying that Personal User Submission to you and providing you the Services necessary to do so.\n\nIf you share a User Submission in a public “community” on the Services or in a manner that more than just you or your Limited Access Group can view (a “Public User Submission”), then you grant Yellow Circle the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of displaying that Public User Submission to all Yellow Circle users and providing you the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with Yellow Circle, provided that Yellow Circle will try to notify you if it uses your Public User Submission for any reason other than displaying it on the Services. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.\n\nYou agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, irrevocable, and worldwide, for as long as your User Submissions are stored with us. When you delete your Yellow Circle account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from Yellow Circles records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.\n\nFinally, you understand and agree that Yellow Circle, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media.\n\nDMCA Takedown Policy\nYou may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers like Yellow Circle removing material that they believe in good faith violates someone’s copyright. To learn more about DMCA, click here.\n\nWHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT I SEE AND DO ON THE SERVICES?\nAny information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. The Services may contain, or direct you to websites containing, information you may find offensive or inappropriate; we can’t control that, but please let us know if it happens and we’ll try to remedy the situation.\n\nWe also can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.\n\nYou are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.\n\nThe Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned, operated, or controlled by Yellow Circle. When you access third party websites or use third party services (including, without limitation, your use of Publisher Software, defined below), you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Yellow Circle is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.\n\nYellow Circle has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, Yellow Circle will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service (including without limitation the Publisher Software). By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.\n\nYour interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties (including without limitation Publishers). You agree that Yellow Circle shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.\n\nIf there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that Yellow Circle is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Yellow Circle, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”\n\nWILL YELLOW CIRCLE EVER CHANGE THE SERVICES?\nYellow Circle is a dynamic learning tool, so the Services will change over time. We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), or without any reason, and without notice.\n\nDOES YELLOW CIRCLE COST ANYTHING?\nYellow Circle Services are free and always will be – that is, we don’t charge for signing up for an individual Yellow Circle account.\n\nWHAT IF I WANT TO STOP USING YELLOW CIRCLE?\nYou’re free to do that at any time; please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.\n\nYellow Circle is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason, including your breach of these Terms. Yellow Circle has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.\n\nAccount termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important documents you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, or would not be in the interest of someone’s safety or security to do so.\n\nIf you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at support@yellowcircle.net – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.\n\nProvisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.\n\nLEGAL INFORMATION.\nWarranty Disclaimer\nYellow Circle does not make any representations or warranties concerning any content contained in or accessing through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services. We make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products (including Publisher Software) offered or purchased through the Services. Products and services purchased or offered (whether or not following such recommendations and suggestions) through the Services are provided “AS IS” and without any warranty of any kind from Yellow Circle or others (unless, with respect to such others only, provided expressly and unambiguously in writing by a designated third party for a specific product). THE SERVICES, CONTENT, WEBSITE, AND ANY SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nLimitation of Liability\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL YELLOW CIRCLE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $100 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO YELLOW CIRCLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (III) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nIndemnity\nYou agree to indemnify and hold Yellow Circle, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, contractors, and partners harmless for and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).\n\nAssignment\nYou may not assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Yellow Circles prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.\n\nChoice of Law; Arbitration\nThese Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in San Francisco County, California, in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Northern District of California.\n\nMiscellaneous\nYou will be responsible for withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Yellow Circle agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Yellow Circle, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a writing signed by both parties (except as otherwise provided herein). No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Yellow Circle in any respect whatsoever. You and Yellow Circle agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under this Agreement.",

Best of all, there is no one to tell them — “You are going to mess up the family computer”\n\nFew months into this, demand outgrew the small setup in the garage, and Yellow Circle was started to make this learning experience open to everyone.
